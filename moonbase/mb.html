<h1>MOONBASE</h1>

<h2>What is Moonbase?</h2>
<div id="moontext">
    In the Year 2020 Earth A.D., GHOULS discovered $BASED. $BASED contains strange powers that are difficult, if not dangerous, to wield effectively. $BASED doesn't interact with other elements very well.
    To solve this problem, GHOULS built Moonbase and an entire ecosystem was borne. Anyone can stake $BASED in Moonbase to get its refined derivative—<strong>mbBASED</strong>—the native currency of Based Protocol.
    <strong>mbBASED</strong> is a standard token used in the Ethereum Galactic Computer. It works just as any other ERC20-type token and can be used as a composable asset in any Ethereum protocol.
</div>

<h2>What are Rovers?</h2>
<div id="moontext">
    GHOULS bootstrapped this new moon economy by installing a public Rover Launch Console. Rovers tap into the elemental form of $BASED. 
    To get Based, partner projects allocate a portion of their own native token in a Rover. 
    Once the Rover is launched, those tokens get vested—slowly unlocking over the course of one Earth-year. At any moment, 
    anyone can convert the available tokens into $BASED by accessing
    a special function in the Rover console. By doing so, they're able to pilfer 1% of that $BASED. 
    The other 99% gets split between everyone holding mbBASED. This is a safest and most-secure method to get $BASED. 
    GHOULS will always be on Moonbase ready to help harness the continuous 
    stream of memetic energy flowing from $BASED.
    <br><br>
    There are other methods to get $BASED, but they remain <em>extremely volatile, dangerous and potentially harmful to your health</em>.
